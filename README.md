TEIL Biomass Grid Supply Power Project, Khatauli , Uttar Pradesh

The project TEIL Biomass Grid Supply Power Project, Khatauli, Uttar Pradesh is located
at Village: Sheikhpura, City: Khatauli, District: Muzaffarnagar, State: Uttar Pradesh (UP), Country
India (Pin: 251201).

The details of the UCR project activity are as follows:
Purpose of the UCR project activity:
The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity using renewable biomass and thereby
reduce GHG emissions by displacing the fossil fuel dominated grid based electricity with
biomass based renewable electricity. The commissioning date or start date of this UCR project
activity is 19/10/2005 (although the power synchronization to the 132 KV substation was on
18/10/2005).

Hence, the project activity is a grid-connected biomass (bagasse based) cogeneration power plant
with a high pressure steam-turbine configuration. The high pressure boilers are fired by bagasse,
a biomass byproduct from the sugar manufacturing process, to generate steam which in turn is
fed to the steam turbine to generate power. The overall business is integrated with alcohol
distillation and power generation. The power co-generation units generate biomass based power
for captive consumption of the sugar plant and the sale of surplus power to the state grid. The
project plant exports power to the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL), in
absence of the project activity, UPPCL would have withdrawn electricity from northern regional
grid.

##PRIOR HISTORY

The UCR project activity had been registered as a VCS project activity under the title Bagasse based
Co-generation Power Project at Khatauli (Project ID 101).

VCS Registration Date 15/07/2009

VCUs Issued (Period 1) 19/10/2005 - 31/03/2006

VCUs Issued (Period 2) 01/04/2006 - 18/03/2007
______________________
The UCR project activity had been registered as a CDM project activity under the title :Bagasse
based Co-generation Power Project at Khatauli (Project ID 0826).

CDM Registration Date 19/03/2007

Crediting Period 19/03/2007 – 18/03/2017 (Fixed)

CERs Issued (Period 1) 59267 CERs (Period 19/03/2007 – 31/03/2008 )

CERs Issued (Period 2) 50776 CERs (Period 01/04/2008-31/05/2010)

CERs Issued (Period 3) 28312 CERs (Period 01/06/2010-29/02/2012)

Hence the UCR project activity has never been issued voluntary carbon credits for the current
2013-2022 vintage years and there is no double counting of the credits envisioned. Although the PP
is eligible to claim UNFCCC CDM CERs until 18/03/2017, the PP has decided not to claim any
further credits under the CDM program (i.e. post 29/02/2012) and is seeking CoUs under the UCR
program. Additionally, the same has been stated in the undertaking provided in the Double Counting
Avoidance Assurance Document (DAA) by TEIL.

UCR ISSUANCE DATE: 31/08/2023
